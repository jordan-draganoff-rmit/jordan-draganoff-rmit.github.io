<h2>About Me</h2> <p>Hi, my name is Jordan. I was born in the late 1990’s and
grew up in the large country town of Bundaberg, in Queensland. I enjoy an active
lifestyle and love to travel, hike and go jet-skiing. I graduated high school in
2013 and have been working in my parent’s business in the areas of sales,
marketing and web development to name a few. In 2018, I decided to pursue my
dream and started on my journey to become an IT professional.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>Throughout my childhood and adult years I have always been interested in
computers and any new electronic device, and have often been an early adopter of
new technologies. Throughout these years I never really realised that I should,
or could, make a career out of IT. Before changing to IT, I initially started to
study a business/marketing degree which I soon realised was not an ideal fit for
me as I found the marketing work to not be challenging enough for me. I soon
came to a realisation that an IT degree with a minor in a business subject for
exactly the right fit for me.</p>

<p>  I chose RMIT for a couple of reasons; the first being that RMIT courses are
available through Open Universities Australia which means I can enrol in courses
straight away without any prerequisite. I also chose RMIT because they are a
well established and respected university in Australia.</p>

<p>  During my studies I expect get a foundation of knowledge on a wide range of
skills needed for the IT industry. This foundation knowledge could then be
applied to any aspect or niche that I wish to pursue as a career.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Business Analyst - Ecommerce</strong></p>

<p>This job is calling for a business analyst to help a commercial wholesaler
replatform their current ecommerce system to the newest version of Magento. This
position appeals to me as I currently have experience in website development and
am somewhat familiar with Magento. This job pays up to $150,000 for it’s 12
month contract. This type of work appeals to me as I love to travel; this kind
of high paying short contract work will allow me to travel more.</p>

<p>This job is calling for a person with great business and management
skills/experience. It also favours someone with experience in B2B ecommerce and
Majento. For me to pursue a job such as this one, I would first have to gain
more experience in a business analyst position. It would also be greatly
beneficial for me to learn and get more comfortable with the Magento ecommerce
platform.</p>

<p>I will first need to gain some experience working as a business analyst. The
job position of Junior Business Analyst would be a great to gain experience as
often the junior position doesn’t require nearly as much experience. Once I have
gained enough work experience in lower position, I would have a much higher
chance of securing a contract for a high paying business analyst position. It
would also be greatly beneficial for me to become more familiar with common
software used in the B2B selling environment.</p>

<p>The results of the online tests outline that I’m a visual/tactile learner,
have high emotional stability and have a preference for thinking rather than
feeling. These results point out that while I do have good emotional stability,
I may struggle with understanding others emotions. The results such as my
preference for extroversion and agreeableness indicate that other team members
would be happy with my behaviour as part of a team. When forming a team, it
would be beneficial to find other members with a similar learning style of
visual/tactile as this would likely affect communications preferences and
sharing of useful resources throughout the group.</p>

<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>Overview</strong><br></p>

<p>The proposed project will be a device that a cat owner can use to remotely
interact with their cat when they’re not at home.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>Motivation</strong><br></p>

<p>It is apparent that the people of Australia are becoming more tech savvy. The
introduction of a new tech device for cats, if marketed well, will serve the new
generation of cat-loving tech savvy people. The device will be created with
relatively inexpensive technology and components including the Raspberry Pi mini
computer. A low price point will allow this product to be marketed to a large
audience.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>Description</strong><br></p>

<p>The device will be used inside on the floor or other large flat surface such
as a table. It will be connected to AC power. The device will take on a fairly
flat form with an approximately 5 inch screen in the centre. The screen will be
used to provide visual stimulus to the cat, and also stream video from the
owners mobile device if they choose to. The area surrounding the screen will
incorporate LED lights. These lights will provide further stimulus and
attraction for the cat so that the owner can get it’s attention. The device will
also include speakers for auditory stimulus and a way to attract the cat to the
device. Once the owner and cat are connect via the device and mobile application
the owner will be able to see a live video stream from the wide angle camera
that is embedded into the device. The owner will also be able to play a video on
the in-home device to further entertain and interact with the cat.</p>

<p>The device will be powered by the compact Raspberry Pi system such as the Pi
3 Model A+ or B+ which is inexpensive, compact and features a quad-core
processor, support for a display and camera and also supports other connections
via a GPIO header. The Raspberry Pi device will run a basic Linux installation
such as Raspbian Lite along with a custom program to control the devices
functionality.</p>

<p>The device will be remotely controlled by a mobile application on the pet
owners own device. The application will allow the owner to set up the device,
and then control it and see live video from a remote location. The mobile
application will also include an API so that other developers can build in extra
functionality such as connecting to other smart devices in the home, or create
their own device such as a food dispenser. The in-home device program and mobile
app will be built using open source software where possible to save money on
development costs.</p>

<p>The display will be a commercially available LCD, or similar, screen with a
low cost as resolution and image quality are not an important factor. Low cost
LED lights will be arranged around the outside of the screen. Prototypes for the
device body would be 3D printed before a final design and material chose is
chosen that is both low cost and visually appealing.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>Skills Required</strong><br></p>

<p>To bring this project to life, skills including the ability to package the
operating system for the Raspberry Pi including all the programs necessary for
it to function, mobile app development skills, electrical and wiring skills to
connect all electrical parts of the device and CAD modelling and 3D printing
skills to design and develop the design of the device enclosure. I am currently
lacking the programming skills to program the Raspberry Pi and the skills
required to create mobile applications. To learn these skills I would need to
undertake further training and courses in these areas.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>Outcome</strong><br></p>

<p>Overall, this project is feasible but would require me to acquire additional
skills if I was to go ahead with this project without additional outside help in
the areas where I do not have the knowledge or experience. If this project is
successful, it will allow people to interact with their cat in a whole different
way and allow them to go away with less stress about their animal. The impact of
this development may mean that other people may also create interactive pet
products so that people can better intersect with their pets in an ever growing
digital world.</p>
