<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Jordan. I was born in the late 1990’s and grew up in the large country town of Bundaberg, in Queensland. I enjoy an active lifestyle and love to travel, hike and go jet-skiing. I graduated high school in 2013 and have been working in my parent’s business in the areas of sales, marketing and web development to name a few. In 2018, I decided to pursue my dream and started on my journey to become an IT professional.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>Throughout my childhood and adult years I have always been interested in computers and any new electronic device, and have often been an early adopter of new technologies. Throughout these years I never really realised that I should, or could, make a career out of IT. Before changing to IT, I initially started to study a business/marketing degree which I soon realised was not an ideal fit for me as I found the marketing work to not be challenging enough for me. I soon came to a realisation that an IT degree with a minor in a business subject for exactly the right fit for me.</p>
<p>  I chose RMIT for a couple of reasons; the first being that RMIT courses are available through Open Universities Australia which means I can enrol in courses straight away without any prerequisite. I also chose RMIT because they are a well established and respected university in Australia.</p>
<p>  During my studies I expect get a foundation of knowledge on a wide range of skills needed for the IT industry. This foundation knowledge could then be applied to any aspect or niche that I wish to pursue as a career.</p>
