<h2>About Me</h2> <p>Hi, my name is Jordan. I was born in the late 1990’s and
grew up in the large country town of Bundaberg, in Queensland. I enjoy an active
lifestyle and love to travel, hike and go jet-skiing. I graduated high school in
2013 and have been working in my parent’s business in the areas of sales,
marketing and web development to name a few. In 2018, I decided to pursue my
dream and started on my journey to become an IT professional.</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>

<p>Throughout my childhood and adult years I have always been interested in
computers and any new electronic device, and have often been an early adopter of
new technologies. Throughout these years I never really realised that I should,
or could, make a career out of IT. Before changing to IT, I initially started to
study a business/marketing degree which I soon realised was not an ideal fit for
me as I found the marketing work to not be challenging enough for me. I soon
came to a realisation that an IT degree with a minor in a business subject for
exactly the right fit for me.</p>

<p>  I chose RMIT for a couple of reasons; the first being that RMIT courses are
available through Open Universities Australia which means I can enrol in courses
straight away without any prerequisite. I also chose RMIT because they are a
well established and respected university in Australia.</p>

<p>  During my studies I expect get a foundation of knowledge on a wide range of
skills needed for the IT industry. This foundation knowledge could then be
applied to any aspect or niche that I wish to pursue as a career.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Business Analyst - Ecommerce</strong></p>

<p>This job is calling for a business analyst to help a commercial wholesaler
replatform their current ecommerce system to the newest version of Magento. This
position appeals to me as I currently have experience in website development and
am somewhat familiar with Magento. This job pays up to $150,000 for it’s 12
month contract. This type of work appeals to me as I love to travel; this kind
of high paying short contract work will allow me to travel more.</p>

<p>This job is calling for a person with great business and management
skills/experience. It also favours someone with experience in B2B ecommerce and
Majento. For me to pursue a job such as this one, I would first have to gain
more experience in a business analyst position. It would also be greatly
beneficial for me to learn and get more comfortable with the Magento ecommerce
platform.</p>

<p>I will first need to gain some experience working as a business analyst. The
job position of Junior Business Analyst would be a great to gain experience as
often the junior position doesn’t require nearly as much experience. Once I have
gained enough work experience in lower position, I would have a much higher
chance of securing a contract for a high paying business analyst position. It
would also be greatly beneficial for me to become more familiar with common
software used in the B2B selling environment.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p style="text-align:center"> <strong>Big 5 Personality Test</strong><br></p>

<img class="personality-test-image" src="images/big5.png">

<p>The results of the online tests outline that I’m a visual/tactile learner,
have high emotional stability and have a preference for thinking rather than
feeling. These results point out that while I do have good emotional stability,
I may struggle with understanding others emotions. The results such as my
preference for extroversion and agreeableness indicate that other team members
would be happy with my behaviour as part of a team. When forming a team, it
would be beneficial to find other members with a similar learning style of
visual/tactile as this would likely affect communications preferences and
sharing of useful resources throughout the group.</p>
